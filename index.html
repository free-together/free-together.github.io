<h1>Free Together</h1>
    <p>Free Together is dedicated to promoting technological freedom, especially software freedom, in the generation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge. While we focus primarily on universities&mdash;and those who work, teach, and learn at them&mdash;we recognize a strong affinity with institutions such as libraries and museums, and their staff and patrons.</p>

  <p>Our name reflects several facets of our values:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Software freedoms (such as the "<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">four freedoms</a>" of the Free Software Definition) are often expressed primarily in terms of the individual freedoms of users, developers, and user-developers. But these freedoms only become meaningful in a social context, <em>together</em>, as Richard Stallman's <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.pdf">Free Software, Free Society</a> essay collection suggests.
    </li>
    
    <li>In a world which often seems dominated by proprietary software, individuals and institutions face a perpetually uphill battle to increase their software freedom. We need to do this <em>together</em>.
    </li>

    <li>Collaboration: that's how we work with knowledge. Technology greatly facilitates collaboration across many kinds of borders and junctions, but so much of this technology is proprietary: Twitter, Facebook, Google Drive. We need to free <em>together</em>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Founded by Scott Dexter, Erin Glass, and Evan Misshula in the wake of <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2016/">LibrePlanet 2016</a>, Free Together is yet another organization working for freedom.
