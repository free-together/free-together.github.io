<h2 id="orgheadline2">What is CUNY's mission?</h2>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
The Legislature’s intent is that The City University be supported as
an independent and integrated system of higher education on the
assumption that the University will continue to maintain and expand
its commitment to academic excellence and to the provision of equal
access and opportunity for students, faculty and staff from all ethnic
and racial groups and from both sexes. The City University is of vital
importance as a vehicle for the upward mobility of the disadvantaged
in the City of New York. The pioneering efforts of the SEEK and
College Discovery programs must not be diminished as a result of
greater state financial responsibility.

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Why fund two systems?</h2>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
Only the strongest commitment to the special needs of an urban
constituency justifies the Legislature’s support of an independent and
unique structure for the University. Activities at the City University
campuses must be undertaken in a spirit which recognizes and responds
to the imperative need for affirmative action and the positive desire
to have City University personnel reflect the diverse communities
which comprise the people of the city and state of New York.
