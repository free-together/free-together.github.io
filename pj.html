<h1 class="title">Pushing FOSS joy at the university</h1>
<div id="container1">
<p>
This post is adopted from a talk I gave with Evan Misshula and Scott
Dexter at the March 2016 <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2016/">LibrePlanet conference</a> , an annual conference
hosted by the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and dedicated to issues and
activism related to digital freedom. Our collaborative presentation
highlighted the critical role that the university plays in reinforcing
the dominance of “proprietary” or “nonfree software” in today’s
popular market. While Evan and Scott focused on the hazards of
proprietary software in areas within the university explicitly devoted
to computer science, I focused on the dramatic influence of a research
and pedagogy area rarely linked to software politics, that is, the
humanities. Here I argue that proprietary software supports a hidden
and detrimental assumption within the university about the nature of
learning and suggest a collaborative intervention that would enlarge
freedom for software and the university student body alike.
</p>


<p>
There are at least two major ways in which the university reinforces
the dominance of proprietary software. As Scott mentioned in his talk,
and has detailed at great length in his book with Samir Chopra,
Decoding Liberation: The Promise of Free and Open Source Software,
computer science departments are often immersed within a proprietary
culture without adequate recognition of how this inflects their course
of study. The implications of this circumstance should be quite
shocking even to those with little understanding of the
field. Proprietary software, as many of you are already very aware,
obscures the code from the user, and thus within the context of
education, literally hides both the object and instrument of study
from the student. Whatever sort of learning does occur in such a
scenario, we must understand it to be a learning that is obedient and
whose limits are determined in advance.  Anyone interested in the
conditions and importance of critical thought should have much to
meditate upon here.
</p>

<p>
But the computer science department is perhaps one of the more obvious
places to scrutinize. When I hear the free software community discuss
issues related to the university, it is often in regard to departments
that explicitly study computer science or develop their own software.
And of course, it is critical that we attend to the software politics
of the formal site of reproduction of computer science. However, this
is not the only site of software use within the university that
carries great consequence. For the fact of the matter is that
practically speaking every member of the university &#x2013; regardless of
discipline – uses software for almost every aspect of their
professional or student activities.  And this banal everyday usage
arguably strengthens proprietary software’s social and economic grip
just as much as a formal blessing from computer science. From word
processors to learning management systems, the university relies so
deeply on proprietary software that one could hardly imagine the shape
of higher education without it. These activities of course are
completely outside the activities and influence of the computer
science department but they are no less consequential on the
reproduction of proprietary software culture at large.
</p>

<p>
To many FOSS advocates, this may sound like just one more bullet point
in the long list of territories colonized by proprietary
software. However, I think there is something special about the sphere
of higher education especially in regards to its potential to
influence broader culture.  According to the National Center for
Educational Statistics, around 20 million Americans attend some form
of higher education a year. The fact that this number translates
directly into a software user base has not been lost on the edtech
industry which has worked tirelessly to entrench proprietary software
within all aspects of higher education. Their success has meant that
college not only teaches particular subjects of study, but also apathy
and powerlessness with respect to the software systems that shape and
monitor user activities. If the FOSS community is looking for ways to
grow, it should consider intervening not only via important,
grass-roots efforts, but also in higher education, where software
consciousness of the masses is produced and disciplined at scale.
</p>

<p>
How then do we begin to do this?  How do we seize this incredible
opportunity to immerse 20 million students in participatory,
community-oriented software cultures that could potentially reshape
the ways they imagine, contribute to, and politicize software for the
rest of their lives? We could of course focus on communicating the
availability and political import of FOSS to the academic community
and hope that one by one they come to engage more consciously with
their software. On its own, however, I do not think this approach will
be very effective. While the generous educator/administrator/student
will perhaps patiently listen to an explanation about Emacs or
LibreOffice, they will not understand why it’s worth the technical
difficulty or even mild inconvenience when they are already quite
content with the tools they have. In short, I do not think we should
consider the ethical or technical principles as the sole selling
points of FOSS.  As much as the FOSS community might pride itself on
these principles, I would argue that it is actually the communal joy
that these principles make possible which sustains and grows the
community.
</p>

<p>
Nathan Schneider highlights the importance of this communal joy in his
article "<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWlJCv1-bLAhUL9WMKHQM3CLMQFggdMAA&amp;amp;url=https%253A%252F%252Fnewrepublic.com%252Farticle%252F121832%252Fpleasure-do-it-yourself-slow-computing&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFpwqO8T5x6lAOnHwfNIvLjJau1CA&amp;amp;sig2=ZSR08P13v0m4QIOm7eSypg">The Joy of Slow Computing</a>." I think it’s worth excerpting
here as he quite eloquently describes how this joy literally changes
his user experience of software. He writes: I
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
…early on, I noticed that the glitches started to feel different than
they used to. Stuff that would have driven me crazy on a MacBook
didn’t upset me anymore. No longer could I curse some abstract
corporation somewhere. As in Slow Food—with its unhygienic soil,
disorderly farmers’ markets, and inconvenient seasons—the annoyances
of Slow Computing have become pleasures. With community-made software,
there’s no one to blame but us, the community. We’re not perfect, but
we’re working on it. I gave away my MacBook.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
As we concern ourselves with the question of communicating FOSS to new
audiences, it’s important to remember the centrality of this communal
joy. As Schneider’s observations suggest, community can make technical
difficulty feel – and indeed be – meaningful. However, this is not
just any community, but one formed in the process of working towards a
new political reality. The joy of FOSS, as of Slow Food, is in the
creation of a participatory alternative to dominant oppressive
consumer industries. It is the feeling and actualization of
empowerment through cooperation. But this is an extremely difficult
aspect to convey through simple explanation. There is no elevator
pitch to communicate the social value of free software. And so, how
can we preserve this critical, but oh so perishable, aspect of the
FOSS message when communicating with the academic community?
</p>

<p>
I would like to suggest that we do it through experience rather than
words. Concretely, I mean that we should set up a seed FOSS project
that would be of everyday use for the everyday student with visible
and welcoming onramps for participation in development and
governance. Or as Sumana Harihareswara very nicely put in her talk
this weekend, we need to set up “tidepools,” that is, “friendly
newcomer spaces” that protect users from the free software ocean while
preparing them for it. Now, in a moment, I will outline my own vision
for this seed project which is already well under way.  But in to show
you why I think this seed project could be so meaningful for the both
FOSS community and the student community, I would like to share how I,
an English Ph.D. student with strong suspicion towards digital
technology, wound up as a passionate, though somewhat frustrated
advocate for FOSS within the university.
</p>

<p>
Several years ago as a graduate student at The CUNY Graduate Center, I
first became aware that a group within our institution developed and
maintained a FOSS-supported digital commons &#x2013; <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/">The CUNY Academic
Commons</a> &#x2013; for the entire Graduate Center community. This space was
(and still is) used to facilitate digital pedagogy and collaborative
research. It also enables students, staff, faculty, and research
organizations to easily set up websites and communicate across the
community. In a not-entirely coincidental twist of fate, it was in a
class that used the Commons where I was also first exposed to the
ideas of FOSS.  Learning about and discussing the ideas of free
software in a space made possible by free software was an
intellectually transformative experience. I began to see the dramatic
influence of software on academic and student life, especially within
areas that distance themselves from technical matters such as the
humanities. Even more importantly, I was shocked to realize that
proprietary software is an active agent in stifling and segregating
the intellectual activities of students.  This is not the easiest
thing to explain but let me try.  Proprietary software in higher
education – particularly word processors and learning management
systems, the bread and butter of course communications &#x2013; has always
been designed by someone other than the student and implemented for
the sole purpose of enabling an instructor to evaluate student work.
Whatever ideals you might associate with higher education, at the end
of the day, “learning” for the most part is about displaying one’s
knowledge – in an essay, an exam, a report &#x2013; for the sole purpose of
a grade. And the software used to carry out that task reinforces that
individual, hierarchical, evaluative logic of learning.
</p>

<p>
Now this logic might seem perfectly reasonable to you and I’m
certainly not arguing that it has no value. But I’d like to contrast
it with the philosophy of learning inherent in FOSS. If we look at the
four freedoms we see that they create a pedagogical culture that
values the ability to learn from and teach your neighbor. In short,
the four freedoms acknowledge and foster the critical importance and
joyful incentive of collaborative learning. One does not study for a
“grade” so to speak, but to create and share valuable goods within the
community. Proprietary software within education doesn’t only prohibit
software collaboration, but stifles collaboration at every level of
learning and artificially divorces our understanding of intellectual
activity and the software which structures and disciplines it. What
if, then, I thought, we made higher education &#x2013; both its software and
its intellectual activities &#x2013; look a lot more like FOSS?  Could the
same freedoms which enable and incentivize massive global
collaboration among developers also provide a model for forging a
global student community that joyfully co-produced both knowledge and
its structure of circulation? By implementing FOSS in the university
might we make higher education, not just the software of higher
education, more participatory, collaborative, and publicly engaged?
</p>

<p>
This is the hope that drove me &#x2013; initially a technophobic scholar of
literature – to dream up Social Paper, a student-driven collaborative
writing platform, and join up with The CUNY Academic Commons, its
Director Matthew K. Gold, and my co-founder Jennifer Stoops, to
develop it. I’m excited to say that last December we launched a beta
version that is now being piloted at The CUNY Graduate Center with the
invaluable help of many contributors. I will refrain from going into
too much detail about the software itself except to say that it is
designed to foster peer collaboration, public scholarship,
self-reflection, and most importantly, participatory design in ways
that are not possible on other platforms.  (You can read my argument
for Social Paper on the platform itself <a href="https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/papers/45249">here</a> and a proposal for its
global potential <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/social-paper-retooling-student-consciousness">here</a>.)  It has been an incredibly exciting and
transformative experience. However, it is also an incredibly
precarious endeavor.  While we’ve been extremely fortunate in
receiving grant funds, and also participation from an incredibly
talented and generous group of people within the CUNY community, I can
already see how difficult it will be with available resources to
achieve the vision of this platform, much less maintain it as a
sustainable platform for a broader community. I can see now that
growth is often not just an ethical imperative for the FOSS community,
but a survival skill for a FOSS project. I can see that we need to be
better integrated into the FOSS community so as to draw on its counsel
and support if these university FOSS projects are to flourish.
</p>

<p>
And so, I’m asking the FOSS community to consider the critical
importance of everyday software within higher education to its broader
mission. I know that I am by no means the first to raise attention to
this issue, but I find that there is still no coherent community of
FOSS educators nor is there a clearly defined path for the
“non-techie” academics and educators to join the FOSS community. We
need more tide pools. We need more bridges. We need a movement for
free software within higher education. It’s my hope that this plea
will help carry that work along.  Thank you.
